# ðŸ“° NC News API

_An API for a news website inspired by Reddit built with Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL._

A link to the hosted version can be found [here](https://nc-news-api-jqsh.onrender.com/api)

## Project Summary

This is a RESTful API which powers a news app where users can:

- View articles by topic through GET requests
- Post comments under articles with POST requests
- Up/down vote articles using a PATCH request
- Sort articles by date, topic or comment count through queries

The project was built as part of the Northcoders bootcamp to demonstrate the use of Express and PostgreSQL, including RESTful design and testing with Jest and Supertest.

2. Add your database names like this:

    `PGDATABASE=your_dev_db_name`

    `PGDATABASE=your_test_db_name`

3. Then run:

    `npm run setup-dbs`
    `npm run seed`
